<hr>
A place for CTF information, mostly related to challenges, tools and tricks to hopefully make solving these fraggin things a little easier. The idea will be to have two to three sections respectivley (_example: low hanging fruit, challenging and wtf_even_), per topic and/or tool.

#### Miscellianous and Research
> Generally contains the intro challenges and easy points for doing a bit of research and or googling/reading etc

* One of the first ones is almost always a flag for reading the rules or joining/reading the social media discord / slack / twitter / facebook etc. As a general rule and good practise we should do that these anyway as they onften provide hints and tricks during the CTF.

* Fire up one of your preferred search engines that is always available through out the CTF (so best in a seperate window on a seperate screen if you have that setup, or in a new tab in the browser). I normally use a lower resource browser for this task example: Midori or Iridium
