> Bastich _aka_ Lobo Bastich - 2019

<hr>
A place for CTF information, mostly related to challenges, tools and tricks to hopefully make solving these fraggin things a little easier. The idea will be to have two to three sections respectivley (example: low hanging fruit, challenging and wtf_even), per topic and/or tool.

#### Setup / Preperation

> Ready, Set, ...

* Fire up one of your preferred search engines that is always available through out the CTF (so best in a seperate window/browser on a seperate screen if you have that setup, or as a new tab in your browser). I normally use a lower resource browser for this task example: [Midori](https://www.midori-browser.org/download/) or [Iridium](https://iridiumbrowser.de/) so you can leave it open at all times and that is it's only purpose.

#### Misc

> Generally contains the intro challenges and easy points for doing a bit of research and or googling etc.

* One of the first ones is almost always a flag for reading the rules or joining/reading the social media discord / slack / twitter / facebook etc. As a general rule and good practise we should do that these anyway as they onften provide hints and tricks during the CTF.
