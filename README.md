> Bastich _aka_ Lobo Bastich - 2019

<hr>
A place for CTF information, mostly related to challenges, tools and tricks to hopefully make solving these fraggin things a little easier. The idea will be to have two to three sections respectivley (example: low hanging fruit, challenging and wtf_even), per topic and/or tool.

<hr>

#### Setup / Preperation

> Ready, Set, ...

* Fire up one of your preferred search engines that is always available through out the CTF (so best in a seperate window/browser on a seperate screen if you have that setup, or as a new tab in your browser). I normally use a lower resource browser for this task example: [Midori](https://www.midori-browser.org/download/) or [Iridium](https://iridiumbrowser.de/) so you can leave it open at all times and that is it's only purpose.

* Next is main browser tab setup, this almost always consists of following services and resources that have come to the rescue more than I dare to count. 
  * For **crypto** related things [cryptii](https://cryptii.com/), [dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/) and [tio](https://tio.run/)
  * For **payloads** and **shellcode** related things [payloadsallthethings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings), [shell-strorm](http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/)
  * For **forensic** related tasks [file headers](https://www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html), [Online Hex Edit](https://hexed.it/)

<hr>

#### Misc

> Generally contains the intro challenges and easy points for doing a bit of research and or googling etc.

* One of the first ones is almost always a flag for reading the rules or joining/reading the social media discord / slack / twitter / facebook etc. As a general rule and good practise we should do that these anyway as they onften provide hints and tricks during the CTF.
